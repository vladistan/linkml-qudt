# QUDT LinkML Model

## Overview

This is a **first draft attempt** to create a [LinkML](https://linkml.io) model from the [QUDT (Quantities, Units, Dimensions and Types)](https://qudt.org) ontology. QUDT is a comprehensive ontology that provides a structured vocabulary for describing physical quantities, units of measure, and their relationships.

**This is an initial attempt and likely contains numerous issues.** Suggestions and contributions on how to make this more useful are very welcome!

## Original QUDT Files

The original QUDT ontology files are vendored in the `original/` directory:

- [original/qudt.ttl](original/qudt.ttl) - QUDT ontology in Turtle format
- [original/qudt.ofn](original/qudt.ofn) - QUDT ontology in OWL Functional Syntax

## Important Files (Start Here)

- **[project/datadict.md](project/datadict.md)** - Single page data dictionary (Look here first)
- **[src/linkml_qudt/schema/linkml_qudt.yaml](src/linkml_qudt/schema/linkml_qudt.yaml)** - The main LinkML schema
- **[src/linkml_qudt/datamodel/linkml_qudt_pydantic.py](src/linkml_qudt/datamodel/linkml_qudt_pydantic.py)** - Pydantic v2 model

### Additional Generated Artifacts

The `project/` directory contains various generated artifacts:

- [project/jsonld/](project/jsonld/) - JSON-LD context and schema
- [project/jsonschema/](project/jsonschema/) - JSON Schema validation files
- [project/owl/](project/owl/) - OWL/RDF representation (Turtle format)
- [project/shacl/](project/shacl/) - SHACL validation shapes
- [project/shex/](project/shex/) - ShEx schemas
- [project/protobuf/](project/protobuf/) - Protocol Buffers definitions
- [project/sqlschema/](project/sqlschema/) - SQL DDL schemas
- [project/typescript/](project/typescript/) - TypeScript type definitions
- [project/prefixmap/](project/prefixmap/) - Prefix mappings
- [src/linkml_qudt/datamodel/linkml_qudt.py](src/linkml_qudt/datamodel/linkml_qudt.py) - Python dataclasses

## Conversion Process

This LinkML model was created through a two-step automated conversion
process. First, the [ROBOT](http://robot.obolibrary.org/) tool was
used to convert the published QUDT ontology files to OWL Functional
Syntax (OFN) format. Then, [Schema
Automator](https://github.com/linkml/schema-automator) was applied
to generate the LinkML model from the OFN representation.


Unfortunately, the automated conversion process did not yield a usable LinkML schema. The generated output had several structural and type issues. The following corrections were made
to make the schema useful.

- Replaced auto-generated types with LinkML standard types (e.g., `string`, `uriList`, `stringList`)
- Added standard ontology prefixes (`owl`, `rdf`, `rdfs`, `dc`, `dcterms`, `prov`, `voag`, `vaem`, `dtype`)
- Fixed issues with the `PhysicalConstant` class definition
- General cleanup and normalization of schema structure
- Removed redundant `Thing` mixin from `Comment` class (already directly inherited)


## Known Issues & Limitations

ï¿½ **This is a first draft with known limitations:**

- The automated conversion may not have captured all semantic nuances from the QUDT ontology
- Some complex OWL patterns may not translate perfectly to LinkML
- Not all QUDT constraints may be fully represented
- The model may require additional validation rules
- Some class hierarchies may need refinement

## Development
